## Florida Department of Geospacial Data

-How can I use this to find new fishing spots?
--Deep spots near holes? Grid Coordinates?

--Merge and clean the datasets to make a new dataset with names and grid coordinates

-What other columns/data would be relevant? 
--Make a primary ID or name column
--Longitude and Latitude
--Depth
--Make a new column to see how far it is from a certain point on shore or a specific port.
---Find the coordinate for Cape Canaveral for example and use the longitude and latitude to figure out distance.
--Which reefs are closest to us? 
---County
---Coast?
